235	theory	The theory relies on three assumptions:	a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world; an organized system of accepted knowledge that applies in a variety of circumstances to explain a specific set of phenomena,a tentative insight into the natural world; a concept that is not yet verified but that if true would explain certain facts or phenomena,a belief that can guide behavior
236	attendant	1-RRB- Voters can`` buy`` one of two brands when they select their political agents-- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest.	someone who waits on or tends to or attends to the needs of another,a person who is present and participates in a meeting,an event or situation that happens at the same time as or in connection with another,being present (at meeting or event etc.),following or accompanying as a consequence
237	local	2-RRB- Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office-- dealing with national issues-LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large-RRB- and attending to local issues-LRB- constituency service and pork barrel-RRB-.	public transport consisting of a bus or train that stops at all stations or stops,anesthetic that numbs a particular area of the body,relating to or applicable to or concerned with the administration of a city or town or district rather than a larger area,of or belonging to or characteristic of a particular locality or neighborhood,affecting only a restricted part or area of the body

240	incentive	In races for the White House, a voter 's incentive, at the margin, is to lean Republican.	a positive motivational influence,an additional payment (or other remuneration) to employees as a means of increasing output
241	president	Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits.	an executive officer of a firm or corporation,the person who holds the office of head of state of the United States government,the chief executive of a republic,the officer who presides at the meetings of an organization,the head administrative officer of a college or university,the office of the United States head of state

243	theory	While this theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several things.	a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world; an organized system of accepted knowledge that applies in a variety of circumstances to explain a specific set of phenomena,a tentative insight into the natural world; a concept that is not yet verified but that if true would explain certain facts or phenomena,a belief that can guide behavior
244	wins	Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency.	a victory (as in a race or other competition),something won (especially money),be the winner in a contest or competition; be victorious,win something through one's efforts,obtain advantages\, such as points\, etc.,attain success or reach a desired goal
245	policy	Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office.	a plan of action adopted by an individual or social group,a line of argument rationalizing the course of action of a government,written contract or certificate of insurance
246	defeat	For example, first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat.	an unsuccessful ending to a struggle or contest,the feeling that accompanies an experience of being thwarted in attaining your goals,win a victory over,thwart the passage of
247	office	The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982.	place of business where professional or clerical duties are performed,an administrative unit of government,the actions and activities assigned to or required or expected of a person or group,(of a government or government official) holding an office means being in power,professional or clerical workers in an office,a religious rite or service prescribed by ecclesiastical authorities,a job in an organization
248	emphasis	Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role-- spreading the Reagan revolution-- in national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat.	special importance or significance,intensity or forcefulness of expression,special and significant stress by means of position or repetition e.g.,the relative prominence of a syllable or musical note (especially with regard to stress or pitch)
249	difficult	Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.	not easy; requiring great physical or mental effort to accomplish or comprehend or endure,hard to control; \,
250	provide	Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South.	give something useful or necessary to,give what is desired or needed\, especially support\, food or sustenance,determine (what is to happen in certain contingencies)\, especially by including a proviso condition or stipulation,mount or put up,make a possibility or provide opportunity for; permit to be attainable or cause to remain,supply means of subsistence; earn a living,take measures in preparation for
251	power	To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.	possession of controlling influence,(physics) the rate of doing work; measured in watts (= joules/second),possession of the qualities (especially mental qualities) required to do something or get something done,(of a government or government official) holding an office means being in power,one possessing or exercising power or influence or authority,a mathematical notation indicating the number of times a quantity is multiplied by itself,physical strength,a state powerful enough to influence events throughout the world,a very wealthy or powerful businessman,supply the force or power for the functioning of
252	Republicans	Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.	a member of the Republican Party,an advocate of a republic (usually in opposition to a monarchy),a tributary of the Kansas River that flows from eastern Colorado eastward through Nebraska and Kansas,relating to or belonging to the Republican Party,having the supreme power lying in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them or characteristic of such government; - United States Constitution; ; - Philip Marsh; -Nathaniel Hawthorne
253	matters	Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.	a vaguely specified concern,some situation or event that is thought about,that which has mass and occupies space,a problem,(used with negation) having consequence,written works (especially in books or magazines),have weight; have import\, carry weight
254	personal	First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.	a short newspaper article about a particular person or group,concerning or affecting a particular person or his or her private life and personality,particular to a given individual,of or arising from personality,intimately concerning a person's body or physical being,indicating grammatical person
255	personal	To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.	a short newspaper article about a particular person or group,concerning or affecting a particular person or his or her private life and personality,particular to a given individual,of or arising from personality,intimately concerning a person's body or physical being,indicating grammatical person
256	Republicans	Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.	a member of the Republican Party,an advocate of a republic (usually in opposition to a monarchy),a tributary of the Kansas River that flows from eastern Colorado eastward through Nebraska and Kansas,relating to or belonging to the Republican Party,having the supreme power lying in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them or characteristic of such government; - United States Constitution; ; - Philip Marsh; -Nathaniel Hawthorne
257	indicate	This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House.	be a signal for or a symptom of,indicate a place\, direction\, person\, or thing; either spatially or figuratively,to state or express briefly,give evidence of,suggest the necessity of an intervention; in medicine
258	attendance	The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.	the act of being present (at a meeting or event etc.),the frequency with which a person is present,the number of people that are present
259	policy	Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices-- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.	a plan of action adopted by an individual or social group,a line of argument rationalizing the course of action of a government,written contract or certificate of insurance
260	Republican	Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe.	a member of the Republican Party,an advocate of a republic (usually in opposition to a monarchy),a tributary of the Kansas River that flows from eastern Colorado eastward through Nebraska and Kansas,relating to or belonging to the Republican Party,having the supreme power lying in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them or characteristic of such government; - United States Constitution; ; - Philip Marsh; -Nathaniel Hawthorne
261	government	State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/ Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse.	the organization that is the governing authority of a political unit,the act of governing; exercising authority,(government) the system or form by which a community or other political unit is governed,the study of government of states and other political units
262	candidate	A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state 's major- party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.	a politician who is running for public office,someone who is considered for something (for an office or prize or honor etc.)
263	explanation	In sum, at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation.	a statement that makes something comprehensible by describing the relevant structure or operation or circumstances etc.,thought that makes something comprehensible,the act of explaining; making something plain or intelligible
264	teaches	Mr. Zupan teaches at the University of Southern California 's business school.	an English pirate who operated in the Caribbean and off the Atlantic coast of North America (died in 1718),impart skills or knowledge to,accustom gradually to some action or attitude

454	Sport	Sport and fraud law	an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,the occupation of athletes who compete for pay,(Maine colloquial) a temporary summer resident of Maine,a person known for the way she (or he) behaves when teased or defeated or subjected to trying circumstances,someone who engages in sports,(biology) an organism that has characteristics resulting from chromosomal alteration,verbal wit or mockery (often at another's expense but not to be taken seriously),wear or display in an ostentatious or proud manner,play boisterously
455	sanction	Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate wittiness but not the will to get remove of a sanction.	formal and explicit approval,a mechanism of social control for enforcing a society's standards,official permission or approval,the act of final authorization,give sanction to,give authority or permission to,give religious sanction to\, such as through on oath
456	expulsion	The expulsion presumably forged by two players of Real Madrid( Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in European Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behavior is or is not unsportsmanlike and if, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.	the act of forcing out someone or something,squeezing out by applying pressure,the act of expelling or projecting or ejecting
457	minutes	As we all know, a few minutes before the end of the game( that their team had already won), both players deliberately wasted time which made the referee show the second yellow card to both of them.	a unit of time equal to 60 seconds or 1/60th of an hour,an indefinitely short time,a particular point in time,a unit of angular distance equal to a 60th of a degree,a short note,distance measured by the time taken to cover it,infinitely or immeasurably small,characterized by painstaking care and detailed examination
458	league	This way, and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of its group, both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next game of league, against Auxerre, and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase.	an association of sports teams that organizes matches for its members,an association of states or organizations or individuals for common action,an obsolete unit of distance of variable length (usually 3 miles),unite to form a league
459	team	Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned with two games the trainer of the team, Jose Mourinho, and with different economic amounts the implied players.	a cooperative unit (especially in sports),two or more draft animals that work together to pull something,form a team
460	practice	The provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.	a customary way of operation or behavior,systematic training by multiple repetitions,translating an idea into action,the exercise of a profession,knowledge of how something is usually done,carry out or practice; as of jobs and professions,learn by repetition,engage in a rehearsal (of),avail oneself to,engage in or perform
461	sport	It is so extended that it part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed nonetheless by this sport.	an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,the occupation of athletes who compete for pay,(Maine colloquial) a temporary summer resident of Maine,a person known for the way she (or he) behaves when teased or defeated or subjected to trying circumstances,someone who engages in sports,(biology) an organism that has characteristics resulting from chromosomal alteration,verbal wit or mockery (often at another's expense but not to be taken seriously),wear or display in an ostentatious or proud manner,play boisterously
462	organization	Part of the debate arisen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by team of the Real Madrid organization( that in its hymn presumes of nobility and honor, and that has fined its players for analogous acts) and by the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more to his expanded history of histrionic and provoking technician.	a group of people who work together,an organized structure for arranging or classifying,the persons (or committees or departments etc.) who make up a body for the purpose of administering something,the act of organizing a business or an activity related to a business,an ordered manner; orderliness by virtue of being methodical and well organized,the activity or result of distributing or disposing persons or things properly or methodically,the act of forming or establishing something
463	regulation	Anyway, the debate deals with if that type of behavior not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions fraud is committed; then, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sport regulation, but they seem to elude its sense.	an authoritative rule,a principle or condition that customarily governs behavior,the state of being controlled or governed,(embryology) the ability of an early embryo to continue normal development after its structure has been somehow damaged or altered,the act of bringing to uniformity; making regular,the act of controlling or directing according to rule,prescribed by or according to regulation
464	damage	The matter examines the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit.	the occurrence of a change for the worse,loss of military equipment,the act of damaging something or someone,the amount of money needed to purchase something,any harm or injury resulting from a violation of a legal right,inflict damage upon,suffer or be susceptible to damage
465	integrity	One of the advantages that include the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions was n't put into danger, that is to say, there was no violent game.	an undivided or unbroken completeness or totality with nothing wanting,moral soundness
466	advantages	Another of these advantages to which it is alluded to with the fare-play is to avoid that the team of the lawbreaker players takes advantage unjustly of the opposite team, which did not happen either.	the quality of having a superior or more favorable position,(tennis) first point scored after deuce,benefit resulting from some event or action,give an advantage to
467	sanction	They waited for and accepted the sanction with no complaints.	formal and explicit approval,a mechanism of social control for enforcing a society's standards,official permission or approval,the act of final authorization,give sanction to,give authority or permission to,give religious sanction to\, such as through on oath
468	advantage	Another question is what type of advantage the violators obtained in the actions deliberately carried out.	the quality of having a superior or more favorable position,(tennis) first point scored after deuce,benefit resulting from some event or action,give an advantage to
469	players	Here it seems necessary to state that it is n't a disadvantageous situation for rival nor is an obtained benefit in the same game, because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their own team with less players.	a person who participates in or is skilled at some game,someone who plays a musical instrument (as a profession),a theatrical performer,a person who pursues a number of different social and sexual partners simultaneously,an important participant (as in a business deal)
470	players	And neither is it a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on those players.	a person who participates in or is skilled at some game,someone who plays a musical instrument (as a profession),a theatrical performer,a person who pursues a number of different social and sexual partners simultaneously,an important participant (as in a business deal)
471	suspension	But it is about a long term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated first of change, and in addition with this action the players fulfil a sanction game and go to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by card accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle.	a mixture in which fine particles are suspended in a fluid where they are supported by buoyancy,a time interval during which there is a temporary cessation of something,temporary cessation or suspension,an interruption in the intensity or amount of something,a mechanical system of springs or shock absorbers connecting the wheels and axles to the chassis of a wheeled vehicle,the act of suspending something (hanging it from above so it moves freely),a temporary debarment (from a privilege or position etc)
472	advantage	So that, by passing rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.	the quality of having a superior or more favorable position,(tennis) first point scored after deuce,benefit resulting from some event or action,give an advantage to
473	decisions	Those actions are really against the sporting spirit, which is part of the strategic decisions that favor taking advantages allowed by the rules.	the act of making up your mind about something,a position or opinion or judgment reached after consideration,(boxing) a victory won on points when no knockout has occurred,the outcome of a game or contest,the trait of resoluteness as evidenced by firmness of character or purpose
474	law	Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse, in this occasion I believe it was a clear case of wittiness.	the collection of rules imposed by authority,legal document setting forth rules governing a particular kind of activity,a rule or body of rules of conduct inherent in human nature and essential to or binding upon human society,a generalization that describes recurring facts or events in nature,the branch of philosophy concerned with the law and the principles that lead courts to make the decisions they do,the learned profession that is mastered by graduate study in a law school and that is responsible for the judicial system,the force of policemen and officers
475	directive	The controversy seems to arise from two factors: because it was about two auto expulsions and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause them.	a pronouncement encouraging or banning some activity,showing the way by conducting or leading; imposing direction on
476	damage	The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.	the occurrence of a change for the worse,loss of military equipment,the act of damaging something or someone,the amount of money needed to purchase something,any harm or injury resulting from a violation of a legal right,inflict damage upon,suffer or be susceptible to damage
477	organism	`` This organism has dual capability.''	a living thing that has (or can develop) the ability to act or function independently,a system considered analogous in structure or function to a living body
478	phosphorus	`` It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic.''	a multivalent nonmetallic element of the nitrogen family that occurs commonly in inorganic phosphate rocks and as organic phosphates in all living cells; is highly reactive and occurs in several allotropic forms,a planet (usually Venus) seen just before sunrise in the eastern sky
479	edition	`` That makes it very peculiar, though it falls short of being some form of truly` alien' life,'' commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report appearing in Thursday 's online edition of the journal Science.	the form in which a text (especially a printed book) is published,all of the identical copies of something offered to the public at the same time,an issue of a newspaper,something a little different from others of the same type
480	Earth	The find is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar said.	the 3rd planet from the sun; the planet we live on,the loose soft material that makes up a large part of the land surface,the solid part of the earth's surface,the abode of mortals (as contrasted with Heaven or Hell),once thought to be one of four elements composing the universe (Empedocles),the concerns of this life as distinguished from heaven and the afterlife,a connection between an electrical device and a large conducting body\, such as the earth (which is taken to be at zero voltage),hide in the earth like a hunted animal,connect to the earth
481	elements	The discovery`` does show that in other planetary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the` standard' set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed,'' commented Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.	an abstract part of something,an artifact that is one of the individual parts of which a composite entity is made up; especially a part that can be separated from or attached to a system,any of the more than 100 known substances (of which 92 occur naturally) that cannot be separated into simpler substances and that singly or in combination constitute all matter,the most favorable environment for a plant or animal,one of four substances thought in ancient and medieval cosmology to constitute the physical universe,the situation in which you are happiest and most effective,a straight line that generates a cylinder or cone
482	team	Cockell was not part of the research team.	a cooperative unit (especially in sports),two or more draft animals that work together to pull something,form a team
483	substitution	`` This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,'' added Cockell.	an event in which one thing is substituted for another,the act of putting one thing or person in the place of another:
484	discovery	It was n't a chance discovery.	the act of discovering something,something that is discovered,a productive insight,(law) compulsory pretrial disclosure of documents relevant to a case; enables one side in a litigation to elicit information from the other side concerning the facts in the case
485	Arsenic	Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both might be able to substitute one for the other.	a white powdered poisonous trioxide of arsenic; used in manufacturing glass and as a pesticide (rat poison) and weed killer,a very poisonous metallic element that has three allotropic forms; arsenic and arsenic compounds are used as herbicides and insecticides and various alloys; found in arsenopyrite and orpiment and realgar
486	behavior	`` Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is so similar to that of phosphorus.''	manner of acting or controlling yourself,the action or reaction of something (as a machine or substance) under specified circumstances,(behavioral attributes) the way a person behaves toward other people,(psychology) the aggregate of the responses or reactions or movements made by an organism in any situation
487	organisms	`` As a result, organisms have a hard time telling these elements apart.''	a living thing that has (or can develop) the ability to act or function independently,a system considered analogous in structure or function to a living body
488	phosphorus	`` But arsenic is different enough that it does n't work as well as phosphorus, so it gets in there and sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery,'' explained Anbar.	a multivalent nonmetallic element of the nitrogen family that occurs commonly in inorganic phosphate rocks and as organic phosphates in all living cells; is highly reactive and occurs in several allotropic forms,a planet (usually Venus) seen just before sunrise in the eastern sky
489	concentrations	The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which it was able to adapt to and grow.	the strength of a solution; number of molecules of a substance in a given volume,the spatial property of being crowded together,strengthening the concentration (as of a solute in a mixture) by removing diluting material,increase in density,complete attention; intense mental effort,bringing together military forces,great and constant diligence and attention
490	moon	The microbe does grow better on phosphorus, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.	the natural satellite of the Earth,any object resembling a moon,the period between successive new moons (29.531 days),the light of the Moon,United States religious leader (born in Korea) who founded the Unification Church in 1954; was found guilty of conspiracy to evade taxes (born in 1920),any natural satellite of a planet,have dreamlike musings or fantasies while awake,be idle in a listless or dreamy way,expose one's buttocks to
491	Earth	Arsenic was more common in the early times on Earth, she said, so researchers have speculated that early life forms might have used it.	the 3rd planet from the sun; the planet we live on,the loose soft material that makes up a large part of the land surface,the solid part of the earth's surface,the abode of mortals (as contrasted with Heaven or Hell),once thought to be one of four elements composing the universe (Empedocles),the concerns of this life as distinguished from heaven and the afterlife,a connection between an electrical device and a large conducting body\, such as the earth (which is taken to be at zero voltage),hide in the earth like a hunted animal,connect to the earth

493	Crime	Crime has become a bigger worry than unemployment.	(criminal law) an act punishable by law; usually considered an evil act,an evil act not necessarily punishable by law
494	United States	And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region.	North American republic containing 50 states - 48 conterminous states in North America plus Alaska in northwest North America and the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean; achieved independence in 1776,the executive and legislative and judicial branches of the federal government of the United States
495	poll	Those are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.	an inquiry into public opinion conducted by interviewing a random sample of people,the top of the head,the part of the head between the ears,a tame parrot,the counting of votes (as in an election),get the opinions (of people) by asking specific questions,vote in an election at a polling station,get the votes of,convert into a pollard

500	woes	A decade ago economic woes in Latin America undermined support for democracy.	misery resulting from affliction,intense mournfulness
501	world	That it has held up during the world financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.	everything that exists anywhere,people in general; especially a distinctive group of people with some shared interest,all of your experiences that determine how things appear to you,the 3rd planet from the sun; the planet we live on,people in general considered as a whole,a part of the earth that can be considered separately,the concerns of this life as distinguished from heaven and the afterlife,all of the living human inhabitants of the earth,involving the entire earth; not limited or provincial in scope

504	president	Brazil 's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress.	an executive officer of a firm or corporation,the person who holds the office of head of state of the United States government,the chief executive of a republic,the officer who presides at the meetings of an organization,the head administrative officer of a college or university,the office of the United States head of state
505	crime	For only the second time since the polls began, more respondents across Latin America as a whole cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most important problem facing their country( see chart 5).	(criminal law) an act punishable by law; usually considered an evil act,an evil act not necessarily punishable by law
506	year	Some 31% say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year, but that is down from 38% last year and is the lowest figure since 1995.	a period of time containing 365 (or 366) days,a period of time occupying a regular part of a calendar year that is used for some particular activity,the period of time that it takes for a planet (as\, e.g.\, Earth or Mars) to make a complete revolution around the sun,a body of students who graduate together
507	development	A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy: some 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, up from 56% in 2007( see chart 6).	act of improving by expanding or enlarging or refining,a process in which something passes by degrees to a different stage (especially a more advanced or mature stage),(biology) the process of an individual organism growing organically; a purely biological unfolding of events involved in an organism changing gradually from a simple to a more complex level,a recent event that has some relevance for the present situation,the act of making some area of land or water more profitable or productive or useful,a district that has been developed to serve some purpose,a state in which things are improving; the result of developing (as in the early part of a game of chess),processing a photosensitive material in order to make an image visible,(music) the section of a composition or movement (especially in sonata form) where the major musical themes are developed and elaborated
